</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Interview -->

#### Interview Guide

- Semistructured interviews
- Developed based on the research questions
- Encourages an organic exchange of ideas
- Includes directives that provide information about what is expected from each question and
follow-up questions

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Interview -->

#### Data Analysis

- Qualitative coding procedure combining two strategies (1) a concept-driven
way; (2) a data-driven way
- Four main categories: _Challenges_, _Opportunities_, _Open Science Practices_, _Open Science Knowledge_
- Full transcription
- Coding labels defined based on the data and our understanding of the subject

### Results
</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Results -->

#### RQ3: What does the researcher think about Sustainable Research Software?

- He admires the efforts to make the software more sustainable
- The researcher understands the importance of replication
- He strongly endorses sustainable RS for the research group
- He thinks the research groups need guidance and support in the early stages of adopting sustainable practices


<!--
- The researcher admires efforts to make the software more sustainable
- He emphasizes the need for guidance and support in the early stages of adopting sustainable practices
- He strongly endorse sustainable RS for the research group
- Underscore the researcher’s support for sustainable RS practices
-->


</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Results -->

#### RQ4: What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of practices to help RS be sustainable?

- The lack of an institutional support
- Protection of their intellectual contributions, and the fear of compromising the integrity and
credibility of their research if shared prematurely
- The lack of familiarity of RS developers with best practices in
code development

<!--
- need for an institutional hosting server for the research’s
code and data
- policies to support the development and maintenance of sustainable RS
- staff support and guidelines to prioritize and encourage sustainable practices in
their research
- the protection of their intellectual contributions, and the fear of compromising the integrity and
credibility of their research if shared prematurely
- The lack of familiarity of RS developers with best practices in
code development
-

### Discussion
</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Limitations

- The related findings are limited to a specific time, place, and condition and do not imply any generalization.
- Future interviews should include researchers from different study fields

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Positive Feedback

- The semistructured interview format with researchers is preferred over the survey
  - It allows discussions
  - Provides an opportunity to reflect on their own practices
  - The discussions contribute to researchers’ understanding of the subject
  - A tool for promoting awareness, knowledge sharing, and behavior change

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Improvement Opportunities (1)

- The length could be an issue. The duration should not be more than 40 minutes
- It should include more questions related to the support needed from the institution
- Enhance understanding of the concepts by incorporating clear definitions and examples


</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Improvement Opportunities (2)

- Sharing relevant materials containing key concepts before the interview
- Institutions should invest resources in addressing software research, open science policies, practices, training and scientific infrastructures

> The finding helped us structuring a coding framework.

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Conclusion (2) -->
