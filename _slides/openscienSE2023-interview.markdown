<section>

<!-- ### Interview -->

#### Participants

A convenient sample of participants was selected due to general lack of availability and narrow time limit of researchers with such profile.


</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Interview -->

#### Interview Guide

- Semistructured interviews
- Developed based on the research questions
- Encourages an organic exchange of ideas
- Includes directives that provide information about what is expected from each question and
follow-up questions

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Interview -->

#### Data Analysis

- Qualitative coding procedure combining two strategies (1) a concept-driven
way; (2) a data-driven way
- Four main categories: _Challenges_, _Opportunities_, _Open Science Practices_, _Open Science Knowledge_
- Full transcription
- Coding labels defined based on the data and our understanding of the subject

<section>

<!-- ### Pilot Interview Study -->

#### Context

- 1 participant: a senior researcher in Applied Physics with over 30 years of research experience
- Open-ended interview following the interview guide
- The interview was recorded

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Pilot Interview Study -->

#### After the interview

- The interview was fully transcribed
- The transcripts were reviewed and relevant codes were assigned to specific segments
- In each iteration the coding structure was being refined to develop a coding framework.

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Pilot Interview Study -->

#### Coding Framework

- 32 coding labels were identified during the coding process

- The coding structure defined after the analysis of the segments were organized in four categories


</section>

### Results
</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Results -->

#### RQ3: What does the researcher think about Sustainable Research Software?

- He admires the efforts to make the software more sustainable
- The researcher understands the importance of replication
- He strongly endorses sustainable RS for the research group
- He thinks the research groups need guidance and support in the early stages of adopting sustainable practices


<!--
- The researcher admires efforts to make the software more sustainable
- He emphasizes the need for guidance and support in the early stages of adopting sustainable practices
- He strongly endorse sustainable RS for the research group
- Underscore the researcher’s support for sustainable RS practices
-->


</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Results -->

#### RQ4: What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of practices to help RS be sustainable?

- The lack of an institutional support
- Protection of their intellectual contributions, and the fear of compromising the integrity and
credibility of their research if shared prematurely
- The lack of familiarity of RS developers with best practices in
code development

<!--
- need for an institutional hosting server for the research’s
code and data
- policies to support the development and maintenance of sustainable RS
- staff support and guidelines to prioritize and encourage sustainable practices in
their research
- the protection of their intellectual contributions, and the fear of compromising the integrity and
credibility of their research if shared prematurely
- The lack of familiarity of RS developers with best practices in
code development
-
-->

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Results -->

#### RQ5:  What are the supporting factors for adopting practices that help RS be sustainable?

- Recognition of the benefits and importance of adopting sustainability practices
- Promote reproducibility, contributing to scientific knowledge’s overall reliability and robustnes
- Opportunity for other experts in the field to collaborate on software development
- Extend the impact beyond the research community

<!--
- He expressed enthusiasm and accepted the presented practices once we introduced them
- recognition of the benefits and importance of adopting sustainability practices in their RS development
- commitment to promoting reproducibility in their research, contributing to scientific knowledge’s overall reliability and robustnes
- opportunity for other experts in the field to collaborate on software development, provide feedback and suggest improvements
- extend the impact
beyond the research community, benefiting the general public

### Discussion
</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Limitations

- The related findings are limited to a specific time, place, and condition and do not imply any generalization.
- Future interviews should include researchers from different study fields

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Positive Feedback

- The semistructured interview format with researchers is preferred over the survey
  - It allows discussions
  - Provides an opportunity to reflect on their own practices
  - The discussions contribute to researchers’ understanding of the subject
  - A tool for promoting awareness, knowledge sharing, and behavior change

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Improvement Opportunities (1)

- The length could be an issue. The duration should not be more than 40 minutes
- It should include more questions related to the support needed from the institution
- Enhance understanding of the concepts by incorporating clear definitions and examples


</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Discussion -->

#### Improvement Opportunities (2)

- Sharing relevant materials containing key concepts before the interview
- Institutions should invest resources in addressing software research, open science policies, practices, training and scientific infrastructures

### Conclusion
</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Conclusion (1)-->

> Interviews offer a rich and interactive space for discussions

<!-- allowing exploration of participant’s experiences, opinions and challenges. -->

> A talk, prior to the interview, with the fundamental concepts is important.

> The finding helped us structuring a coding framework.

</section>

<section>

<!-- ### Conclusion (2) -->

> By embracing the strengths and addressing the limitations identified, we will be able to understand the current practices adopted, the challenges and supporting factors to develop sustainable RS.
